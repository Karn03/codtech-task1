## Credit Card Fraud Detection using Snap ML

### Introduction

Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue that poses significant financial risks to individuals and businesses alike. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging the power of Snap ML, a high-performance machine learning library, we aim to create a solution that effectively identifies anomalous patterns in transaction data, thereby mitigating financial losses.

# Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a growing concern, resulting in substantial financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions. The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

#### Methodology
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
   * Obtain a suitable credit card transaction dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
   * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data characteristics and identify potential patterns.
   * Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   * Feature engineering to create informative features that enhance model performance.

2. Model Development:
   * Employ Snap ML to build and train various machine learning models, including:
     * Logistic Regression
     * Decision Trees
     * Random Forest
     * Support Vector Machine
   * Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

3. Model Evaluation and Deployment:
   * Assess the chosen model's performance on a holdout test set.
   * Deploy the model into a real-world environment for continuous fraud detection.
   * Monitor model performance and retrain as needed to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

 Expected Outcomes
* A high-performance machine learning model capable of accurately detecting credit card fraud.
* Improved fraud detection rates, leading to reduced financial losses.
* Insights into fraud patterns and trends to inform prevention strategies.
